/*
The challenge here is to read nn lines of input until you reach EOF, then number and print all nn lines of content.

Hint: Java's Scanner.hasNext() method is helpful for this problem.

Input Format.
Read some unknown nn lines of input from stdin(System.in) until you reach EOF; each line of input contains a non-empty String.

Output Format
For each line, print the line number, followed by a single space, and then the line content received as input:

k This is the line read as input for line number 'k'.
Sample Input

Hello world
I am a file
Read me until end-of-file.
Sample Output

1 Hello world
2 I am a file
3 Read me until end-of-file.

        int i=1;
        while (sc.hasNext()) {
        	String s=sc.nextLine();
        	System.out.println(i + " " + s);
        	i++;
        }
